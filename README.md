### Conversion of Regular Expression into Non-Deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA)

**Thompson's construction algorithm** ,which converts the RE step-by-step into an NFA by breaking down the expression into smaller sub-expressions. The most common operations in regular expressions include:
- Concatenation: For example, `ab`
- Union (OR): For example, `a|b`
- Kleene Star: For example, `a*`

#### NFAState Class:
- Represents a state in the NFA, with transitions for specific symbols and Îµ (epsilon) transitions.
#### NFA Class:
- Represents the entire NFA with a start state and an accept state.

#### Steps to run the code:
1. Install Python 3.11
2. Open the terminal
3. Type `python re2nfa.py`
